# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To use the Process Mining component, [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) is required.
You can evaluate yFiles for 60 days free of charge on [my.yworks.com](https://my.yworks.com/signup?product=YFILES_HTML_EVAL).
See [Licensing](https://docs.yworks.com/react-yfiles-process-mining/introduction/licensing) for more information on this topic.

You can learn how to work with the yFiles npm module in our [Developerâ€™s Guide](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/yfiles_npm_module). A convenient way of getting access to yFiles is to use the [yFiles Dev Suite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yfiles-dev-suite).


## Project Setup

1. **Installation**

   In addition to yFiles, the Process Mining component requires React to be installed in your project.
   If you want to start your project from scratch, we recommend using vite:
   ```
   npm create vite@latest my-process-mining-app -- --template react-ts
   ```

   Add the yFiles dependency:
   ```
   npm install <yFiles package path>/lib/yfiles-30.0.0+dev.tgz
   ```

   <details>

   <summary>Sample <code>package.json</code> dependencies</summary>
   The resulting package.json dependencies should resemble the following:

   ```json
      "dependencies": {
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
        "@yfiles/yfiles": "./lib/yfiles-30.0.0.tgz"
     }
   ```
   </details>

   Now, the component itself can be installed:
   ```bash
   npm install @yworks/react-yfiles-process-mining
   ```

2. **License**

   Be sure to invoke <TypeLink type="registerLicense" /> before using the Process Mining React component.
   When evaluating yFiles, the license JSON file is found in the `lib/` folder of the yFiles for HTML evaluation package.
   For licensed users, the license data is provided separately.

   <details>

   <summary>License registration</summary>

   Import or paste your license data and register the license, e.g. in `App.tsx`:

   ```js
   import yFilesLicense from './license.json'

   registerLicense(yFilesLicense)
   ```
   </details>

3. **Stylesheet**

   Make sure to import the CSS stylesheet as well:

   ```js
   import '@yworks/react-yfiles-process-mining/dist/index.css'
   ```

4. **Usage**

   You are now all set to utilize the Process Mining component with your data!
   See a basic example `App.tsx` below:

   ```tsx
   import {
     ProcessMining,
     registerLicense
   } from '@yworks/react-yfiles-process-mining'

   import '@yworks/react-yfiles-process-mining/dist/index.css'

   import yFilesLicense from './license.json'

   registerLicense(yFilesLicense)

   const eventLog = [
     { caseId: 0, activity: 'Start', timestamp: 8.383561495922297, duration: 0.0006804154279300233 },
     { caseId: 0, activity: 'Step A', timestamp: 8.928697652413142, duration: 0.10316578562597925 },
     { caseId: 0, activity: 'Step B', timestamp: 9.576999594529966, duration: 0.041202953341980784 },
     { caseId: 0, activity: 'End', timestamp: 10.163338704362792, duration: 0.2746326125522593 }
   ]

   function App() {
     return <ProcessMining eventLog={eventLog}></ProcessMining>
   }

   export default App
   ```

   > **Note:** By default, the <TypeLink type="ProcessMining" /> component adjusts its size to match the size of its parent element. Therefore, it is necessary to set the dimensions of the containing element or apply styling directly to the <TypeLink type="ProcessMining" /> component. This can be achieved by defining a CSS class or applying inline styles.

## Graph Extraction

To uncover the flow and workload within the event log, the process mining component derives a graph structure that
encapsulates the underlying processes in the log. The nodes of this structure represent the _process steps_, which emerge
when an activity is linked to at least one event. The edges, known as _transitions_, are inferred from consecutive
events associated with two steps, representing movement from one process step to another. For instance, in the event
log provided below, two process steps will emerge, linked to activities 'Start' and 'Step A', along with a
transition between them.

```tsx
const eventLog = [
  { caseId: 0, activity: 'Start', timestamp: 8.2, duration: 0.2 },
  { caseId: 0, activity: 'Step A', timestamp: 8.9, duration: 0.1 },
] satisfies ActivityEvent[]
```

[Transition events](../features/transition-events) essentially bridge the gap between events and can be visualized
with small circles on a transition.

The number of simultaneous events at a process step or transition contributes to a heat history, accessible at any timestamp
within the event log's range. A heatmap serves to visualize the current activity intensity.

To gain a comprehensive overview of changes across the entire event log, you can dynamically traverse the timespan.
This approach helps clarify how things change over different time periods, providing a clearer picture of how processes
and workloads evolve.
